		<p> I&#39;m a STEM & Instructional Technology Specialist.  I do professional development, helping teachers learn how to implement STEM and Problem-Based Learning in their classrooms.
		My background is as a middle school science teacher.
		</p>
		<p> I am currently working on an education initiative I conceived, co-founded, and manage.  The purpose of this initiative is empowering students with grit and solution design skills. We aim to do this by empowering teachers with the instructional tools that best serve 21st century learners &mdash; namely, Problem-Based Learning and STEM. By creating a web-based community (4000+ members, growing daily!) where educators can share and discuss this new style of instruction, we hope to get the best and most functional learning experience to students.
		</p>
		<p> I am excited about learning programming in order to build my design-vision for a stand alone online portal/lesson database.  This database will make our community more school-accessible for teachers ...and most importantly deliver a better education experience to teachers and kids!
		</p>
		<p> While not shaking things up in the science lab or classroom, I kickbox, obstacle-course race, and standup paddleboard. I love squirrels, and I can fold a fitted sheet.
